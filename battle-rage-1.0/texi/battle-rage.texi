@section @strong{battle-rage} and his joystick rules


@quotation

@strong{battle-rage} has some rules for playing with the joystick.

According to the fact that you have @strong{2 hands} and @strong{2 foots} (exclude for the physic handicap).

@strong{battle-rage} follow @strong{the same logic} for the @emph{joystick} buttons @strong{logic}:


@itemize +

@item 
The @strong{back hand} from your fighter is @strong{activate} by @code{pressing} the @emph{A} button from the @emph{joystick}.

@item 
The @strong{front hand} from your fighter  is @strong{activate} by @code{pressing} the @emph{X} button from the @emph{joystick}.

@item 
The @strong{front foot} from your fighter is @strong{activate} by @code{pressing} the @emph{B} button from the @emph{joystick}.

@item 
The @strong{back foot} from your fighter is @strong{activate} by @code{pressing} the @emph{Y} button from the @emph{joystick}.
@end itemize

@*note: 
You can sea that like a cross which @strong{X} axis is are the foots and the @strong{Y} axis the hands.


You can use @strong{combinations} by adding a direction from the @strong{directional keypad} to the used button.

This will generate different kicks for every combination.

@strong{Finally} all combination make sens, @emph{per example}:

Pressing the @strong{Up} arrow and an @strong{hand button} will produce an @strong{uppercut},

and pressing the :@strong{Back arrow} and a @strong{foot kick} will produce a @strong{return foot kick}.

@cartouche
@quotation Warning 
because @code{nothing is perfect} it can happen that a combination don't really

represent what it should like explain above.

But @strong{I guarantee} that it really @strong{doesn't happen often} and that the replacement @strong{is near from your expecting}.

And some kicks have fallbacks: this mean that 2 differents combination can give the same kick: not often.

All according the fighter.
@end quotation
@end cartouche

@*note: 
Because it's easier to press a button instead of using a combination the combinations inflict more damage.


@cartouche
@quotation Note 
This logic is follow for every @strong{joystick} model since you have to configure your @strong{joystick} first.

But you can @strong{reconfigure} your @strong{joystick} if you make a misstake during the configuration phase.

@strong{battle-rage} doesn't claim to take in charge every different joystick model of the world but:

@cartouche
@quotation Note 
@strong{battle-rage} does the best for taking in charge the most of different joystick models.

And you must pass through a @emph{joystick configuration phase}, which is oblige,

every time you @strong{plug a new joystick model}.

@strong{Not} every time you plug your(s) @emph{joystick} to @strong{play the game} !

@*warning: 
To know that every time you plug a new joystick model you will have to configure it.


That's better for all: the game logic, you, conversation about battle rage,...

Because it permit to set a precise combination set, not in according differents joysticks models mess, but acccording to the game.

@quotation

If you have bad luck and your @emph{joystick} model is really not compatible with battle rage, havoc.

Else, @code{if you made an error}, you can try to reconfigure your @emph{joystick} again by using the configure joystick menu item.

@*note: 
Sea the technical note for further informations@footnote{technical-notes-about-joystick-config}.

@quotation

Internally @strong{battle-rage} suppose that the buttons @emph{A}, @emph{B}, @emph{Y} and @emph{Y} have all a value comprise between included @emph{[0-3]} like the most @emph{joysticks} does.

Internally @strong{battle-rage} suppose that directional pad is implemented as 2 axis (@emph{B} and @emph{Y} for the @strong{X} axis and @emph{A} and @emph{X} for the y axis).

But you can predict @strong{nor} the @code{SDL2}: if an axis number will be the @strong{X} or the @strong{Y} most common joytsick use 0 for @strong{X} and 1 for @strong{Y}...

But the sticks: analogical and digital are taking in charge, because with @strong{battle-rage} you must configure you joystick the first time you plug it.

And the big problem is that some joystick doesn't respect at all this rules.

I can only test this values which are right for my test @emph{joysticks} (2 joysticks which works differently).

So if your @emph{joystick} work otherwise than with this values for this set of buttons or axis @strong{it won't work at all !}

This fact is coming from that I use an @code{Input_Handler} written by @strong{Shaun Mitchell}, for his book @code{SDL Game Development (june 2013) [Packt Pusblishing]}.

I @strong{enhance} this @code{Input_Handler} to take in charge the most of joytsick possible: The most common.

Even if the base joystick for @strong{Shaun Mitchell} (an @code{X Box 360} @strong{joystick}) won't work with @strong{battle rage} because of the fail of one axe.

But you can play @strong{battle-rage} with an @code{X Box 360} @strong{joystick} but the @strong{Y} axis won't work !

@*note: 
Great thanks to @strong{Shaun Mitchell} for his book and code writing and his code.
