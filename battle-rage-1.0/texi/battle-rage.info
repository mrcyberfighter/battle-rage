4.1 Introduction:
=================

     *All fighters* have a common *note set of kicks: 1f. in
     relationship

     to the joystick button with or without a direction bouton, on the
     directional pad from your joystick:

              +-----+             +---+
              |  ↑  |             | B |
          +---+     +---+  +---+  +---+  +---+
          | ←         → |  | A |         | X |

              |  ↓  |             | Y |
              +-----+             +---+

        + The *back hand* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _A_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *front hand* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _X_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *front leg* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _B_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *back leg* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _Y_ button from the _joystick_.

     So you get the following differents combinations:

     Warning: because ‘nothing is perfect’ it can happen that a
     combination don’t really

     represent what it should like explain above.

     But *I guarantee* that it really *doesn’t happen often* and that
     the replacement *is near from your expecting*.

     And some kicks have fallbacks: this mean that 2 differents
     combination can give the same kick: not often.

     All according the fighter.

File: battle-rage.info,  Node: battle-rage joystick usage,  Next: battle-rage and his joystick rules,  Prev: The joystick plan,  Up: Joystick s logic of battle-rage

5.2 *battle-rage* joystick usage
================================

     For playing *battle-rage* you only need the the *4* buttons _A_,
     _B_, _Y_ and _Y_ and a *directional pad* (stick).

     The button at the top of the joystick (‘RF’, ‘RB’, ‘LF’, ‘LB’)
     aren’t used.

     You can use the *digital* stick (_directional pad_), *which is
     recommanded*, as well as the *analogical* stick.


     warning: I can’t guarantee you that you can use twice stick at the
     same time once your joystick configured.


File: battle-rage.info,  Node: battle-rage and his joystick rules,  Next: The different joysticks models handling,  Prev: battle-rage joystick usage,  Up: Joystick s logic of battle-rage

5.3 *battle-rage* and his joystick rules
========================================

     *battle-rage* has some rules for playing with the joystick.

     According to the fact that you have *2 hands* and *2 foots*
     (exclude for the physic handicap).

     *battle-rage* follow *the same logic* for the _joystick_ buttons
     *logic*:

        + The *back hand* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _A_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *front hand* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _X_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *front foot* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _B_ button from the _joystick_.

        + The *back foot* from your fighter is *activate* by ‘pressing’
          the _Y_ button from the _joystick_.


     note: You can sea that like a cross which *X* axis is are the foots
     and the *Y* axis the hands.

     You can use *combinations* by adding a direction from the
     *directional keypad* to the used button.

     This will generate different kicks for every combination.

     *Finally* all combination make sens, _per example_:

     Pressing the *Up* arrow and an *hand button* will produce an
     *uppercut*,

     and pressing the :*Back arrow* and a *foot kick* will produce a
     *return foot kick*.

          Warning: because ‘nothing is perfect’ it can happen that a
          combination don’t really

          represent what it should like explain above.

          But *I guarantee* that it really *doesn’t happen often* and
          that the replacement *is near from your expecting*.

          And some kicks have fallbacks: this mean that 2 differents
          combination can give the same kick: not often.

          All according the fighter.


     note: Because it’s easier to press a button instead of using a
     combination the combinations inflict more damage.

          Note: This logic is follow for every *joystick* model since
          you have to configure your *joystick* first.

          But you can *reconfigure* your *joystick* if you make a
          misstake during the configuration phase.

5.4 The different joysticks models handling
===========================================

     *battle-rage* doesn’t claim to take in charge every different
     joystick model of the world but:

          Note: *battle-rage* does the best for taking in charge the
          most of different joystick models.

          And you must pass through a _joystick configuration phase_,
          which is oblige,

          every time you *plug a new joystick model*.

          *Not* every time you plug your(s) _joystick_ to *play the
          game* !


          warning: To know that every time you plug a new joystick model
          you will have to configure it.

          That’s better for all: the game logic, you, conversation about
          battle rage,...

          Because it permit to set a precise combination set, not in
          according differents joysticks models mess, but acccording to
          the game.


File: battle-rage.info,  Node: Advice,  Next: If the joystick configuration fail,  Prev: The different joysticks models handling,  Up: Joystick s logic of battle-rage

5.5 Advice:
===========

     ‘You must better plug the joystick before starting the game.’

     Else you will be notify about the problem and be invited to plug a
     joystick before really starting the game.

     ‘And if you plan to play with 2 users plug 2 joytsick before
     gaming.’

     But you if you don’t have plug 2 joysticks you will be invited to
     do so...

     *Sorry* but my _joystick handler_ doesn’t handle the ‘plug-in
     plug-off’ of _joysticks_,

     so the free hot plug of _joystick(s)_ is not permit with
     *battle-rage*.


File: battle-rage.info,  Node: If the joystick configuration fail,  Next: Technical notes about joystick handle,  Prev: Advice,  Up: Joystick s logic of battle-rage

5.6 If the joystick configuration fail.
=======================================

     If you have bad luck and your _joystick_ model is really not
     compatible with battle rage, havoc.

     Else, ‘if you made an error’, you can try to reconfigure your
     _joystick_ again by using the configure joystick menu item.

File: battle-rage.info,  Node: Technical notes about joystick handle,  Prev: If the joystick configuration fail,  Up: Joystick s logic of battle-rage

5.7 Technical notes about joystick handle.
==========================================

     Internally *battle-rage* suppose that the buttons _A_, _B_, _Y_ and
     _Y_ have all a value comprise between included _[0-3]_ like the
     most _joysticks_ does.

     Internally *battle-rage* suppose that directional pad is
     implemented as 2 axis (_B_ and _Y_ for the *X* axis and _A_ and _X_
     for the y axis).

     But you can predict *nor* the ‘SDL2’: if an axis number will be the
     *X* or the *Y* most common joytsick use 0 for *X* and 1 for *Y*...

     But the sticks: analogical and digital are taking in charge,
     because with *battle-rage* you must configure you joystick the
     first time you plug it.

     And the big problem is that some joystick doesn’t respect at all
     this rules.

     I can only test this values which are right for my test _joysticks_
     (2 joysticks which works differently).

     So if your _joystick_ work otherwise than with this values for this
     set of buttons or axis *it won’t work at all !*

     This fact is coming from that I use an ‘Input_Handler’ written by
     *Shaun Mitchell*, for his book ‘SDL Game Development (june 2013)
     [Packt Pusblishing]’.

     I *enhance* this ‘Input_Handler’ to take in charge the most of
     joytsick possible: The most common.

     Even if the base joystick for *Shaun Mitchell* (an ‘X Box 360’
     *joystick*) won’t work with *battle rage* because of the fail of
     one axe.

     But you can play *battle-rage* with an ‘X Box 360’ *joystick* but
     the *Y* axis won’t work !


     note: Great thanks to *Shaun Mitchell* for his book and code
     writing and his code.
